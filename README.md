```lrc
[00:10.25] This room could be haunted, a vision to the blind
[00:16.53] Wishing sleep held me in her arms forever
[00:23.28] Shadows dance around, perfectly blurring up the lines
[00:30.14] Hallucinations start to intertwine
[00:47.14] 
[00:35.29] I open my eyes
[00:41.72] Her face lingers on the walls
[00:49.14] She's stuck on rewind in my mind
[00:56.78] I try to move on, but the past won't leave my bed
[01:21.28] 
[01:05.45] I hear it all the time like the wind between the chimes
[01:11.53] Holding on to what we had together
[01:18.24] A single note of my pеrsistent hopeless lullabiеs
[01:25.08] I know that I can't sleep forever
[01:41.58] 
[01:30.45] I open my eyes
[01:37.45] Her face lingers on the walls
[01:44.17] She's stuck on rewind in my mind
[01:51.52] I try to move on, but the past won't leave my, my bed
[02:18.02] 
[01:59.71] I open my eyes
[02:03.61] Her face lingers on the walls
[02:11.15] She's stuck on rewind in my mind
[02:17.76] I try to move on, but the past won't leave my bed
