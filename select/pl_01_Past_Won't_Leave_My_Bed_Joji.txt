This room could be haunted, a vision to the
blind
Wishing sleep held me in her arms forever
Shadows dance around, perfectly blurring up the
lines
Hallucinations start to intertwine
I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my
bed
I hear it all the time like the wind between the
chimes
Holding on to what we had together
A single note of my persistent hopeless
lullabies
I know that I can't sleep forever
I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my,
my bed
I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my
bed
